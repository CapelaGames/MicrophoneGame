# Gummies Hardware

Welcome to the source code for our game.

It's a website. Usually you can just open those and its fine.

Unfortunately this uses "secure" APIs and so you need to serve it from a server.

If you just want to play the game go to:

https://capelagames.github.io/MicrophoneGame/

Otherwise, you'll need Python 3.6+ (most Python 3s should work actually) to serve the index.

Or if you know of a better way, feel free to serve it yourself.

Run `serve.sh` from the project directory.
